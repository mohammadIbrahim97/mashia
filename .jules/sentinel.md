## 2026-06-19 - Missing Security Headers & Rate Limiting
**Vulnerability:** The application was missing global security headers (`helmet`) and global rate limiting to mitigate common attack vectors and DoS attempts. (We only addressed `helmet` in this PR to keep it small, but rate limiting remains an issue).
**Learning:** Default express/nestjs setup leaves the app open to missing HTTP security headers. The app also heavily relies on OTP rate limiting (Redis) but doesn't have general HTTP endpoint throttling.
**Prevention:** Ensure `helmet` and `@nestjs/throttler` (or equivalent) are part of the boilerplate backend template to prevent shipping APIs without basic protection.

## 2026-06-23 - Sensitive Data Leak in Auth Responses
**Vulnerability:** The `User` entity, which includes `passwordHash` and `totpSecret`, was being returned directly from auth controllers (`register`, `login`, `adminLogin`, `adminTotpVerify`), exposing sensitive fields to clients.
**Learning:** Returning raw TypeORM entities directly from controllers bypasses serialization, leaking internal database fields.
**Prevention:** Always use dedicated Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), like `ProfileResponseDto.fromUser(user)`, to map and sanitize entities before returning them in API responses.

## 2026-08-02 - Missing Rate Limiting on Sensitive Auth Endpoints
**Vulnerability:** The authentication endpoints (login, register, otp send/verify, admin login) lacked endpoint-specific strict rate limiting, relying only on the loose global limit (100 req/min). This left the endpoints vulnerable to brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.
**Learning:** Global rate limits are insufficient for sensitive routes like authentication which require much stricter controls.
**Prevention:** Always apply strict endpoint-specific `@Throttle` decorators to authentication and other sensitive endpoints to prevent automated attacks.
